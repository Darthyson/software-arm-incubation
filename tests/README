SBLib-Cpp Unit Tests
====================

This project contains unit tests for the C++ version of the SB-Lib.
The unit tests are executed on the host computer (PC), not on the ARM.

Prerequisites
-------------

- 32bit GCC
- Catch in the Eclipse workspace

Executing
---------

Starting the unit tests (all projects in the tests directory) from within Eclipse 
did not produce any output for me (StefanT) under Linux. Starting the unit tests 
from a shell works fine.
