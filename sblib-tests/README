SBLib Unit Tests
================

This project contains unit tests for the SB-Lib.
The unit tests are executed on the host computer (PC), not on the ARM.

Prerequisites
-------------

- 32bit GCC
- CUnit in the Eclipse workspace

Executing
---------

Starting the unit tests (sblib-tests) from within Eclipse did not produce any output
for me (StefanT) under Linux. Starting the unit tests from a shell works fine.
